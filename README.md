This is a public repo with some the code that I've created while in school at Washington State University.
Each folder is from a different class, only 360 and 460 have complete codes. Other classes will be added as I find them.

NOTE:
This serves as an example of my coding style and what I've learned. I will not be updating the code in anyway. I simply plan on addding a readme for each project to assist the reader in understanding the goals of the project
